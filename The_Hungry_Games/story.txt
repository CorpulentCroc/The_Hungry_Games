24 Competitors (could be changed with a setting in future)
A giant world war that lasted for years led to world peace by holding a special event every few months to keep the peace, 12 areas of the world will send 2 volunteers, (or forced to go) aged 18 and up, to this event to compete to win in an event called the “The Hungry Games”.
The world decided on banning all types of weaponry that could end life after the world war, leading to new inventions of weapons that could fatten, infate, or otherwise incapacitate the competitors. (Dunno what happens to losers yet)
(Story of the player???) The year is 2056, 20 years after the world war that started the “The Hungry Games”. You've known about these games since you were a little kid, watching them on the TV, so you’ve grown quite used to them, but you never thought you would be selected for the event.
